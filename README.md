The Black Friday Sales Prediction project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict how much a customer will spend during Black Friday sales based on their demographic and purchasing behavior.

The dataset used includes information like gender, age, occupation, city category, marital status, and product categories. By analyzing this data, the project aims to uncover patterns in consumer spending and use them to make accurate predictions.

This kind of predictive analysis is highly useful for businesses in the retail and e-commerce sector, helping them optimize marketing strategies, personalize offers, and improve overall sales planning during high-traffic events like Black Friday.
